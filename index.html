        <div class="rela-block caps greyed">Profile</div>
        <p class="long-margin">DevOps-focused engineer with Linux background and practical experience in Python scripting and system
administration (LPIC-1). I’m currently working with Docker and Jenkins to build and automate CI/CD workflows,
and I am actively learning Terraform and Ansible with a focus on Infrastructure as Code.
I am passionate about automation, scalable infrastructure, and improving deployment reliability. I enjoy
digging into systems, understanding how things break, and making them more resilient. I am seeking an
entry-level or junior DevOps role where I can grow, contribute, and learn from real-world production
environments. </p>
        <div class="rela-block caps greyed">Experience</div>

        <h3>Mentoring & Coaching (AionLearn)</h3>
        <p class="light">Full-Time</p>
        <p class="justified">I participated in a professional mentorship and coaching program focused on Python education and student development. During this experience, I was trained not only in technical Python concepts but also in effectively communicating them to learners. The program emphasized structured learning paths, problem-solving techniques, and practical project-based training. Additionally, I gained exposure to sales coaching strategies, learning how to present technical courses clearly and persuasively. This experience strengthened both my technical depth and my ability to guide and support students in their learning journey. </p>
        
        <h3>Computer Engineering Student</h3>
        <p class="light">Part-Time</p>
        <p class="justified">I am a Computer Engineering student with a strong interest in systems, software development, and problem-solving. My academic journey focuses on understanding how software and hardware interact at a deep level. I enjoy building practical projects that strengthen my grasp of operating systems, algorithms, and system design. I am constantly exploring new technologies beyond the classroom to stay aligned with industry trends. Learning by building and experimenting is a core part of how I grow as an engineer. </p>
        
        <h3>Freelance DevOps & Python Scripting</h3>
        <p class="light">Part-Time</p>
        <p class="justified">Alongside my studies, I work as a freelance DevOps and Python scripting specialist. I help clients automate workflows, optimize deployment pipelines, and improve infrastructure efficiency. My work includes writing custom Python scripts, building CI/CD pipelines, and managing cloud-based environments. I focus on delivering scalable and maintainable solutions that reduce manual effort and increase reliability. Automation and clean scripting are at the core of the value I provide.</p>
